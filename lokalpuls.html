  <section class="section">
    <h2>1. Problem</h2>
    <p>In smaller communities, there’s often a lack of digital platforms where people can easily ask questions and get local answers. Existing solutions like Facebook groups or WhatsApp chats are unstructured and often overwhelming.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>2. Goal</h2>
    <p>Create a simple and accessible platform for locals to ask questions and receive reliable, contextual answers from nearby users and institutions.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>3. Research & Insights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We interviewed 15 local residents aged 20–65</li>
      <li>Identified pain points: noise, lack of trust, unclear responses</li>
      <li>Benchmarked Reddit, Nebenan.de, and Facebook groups</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>4. Ideation</h2>
    <p>We explored user flows, information architecture, and early wireframes. Accessibility and clarity were our primary concerns.</p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>5. Design & UX Solutions</h2>
    <p>The UI is designed to feel calm and approachable, with a focus on location, categories, and response clarity. The ask-flow is reduced to 3 intuitive steps.</p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>6. Prototyping & Testing</h2>
    <p>Clickable prototypes were tested with 8 users from the initial interviews. Improvements were made to question categorization and notification settings.</p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>7. Result & Impact</h2>
    <p>The platform was launched in 2 small towns and received over 500 user-generated questions in the first month. Local institutions joined as verified responders.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>8. Reflection</h2>
    <p>I learned how crucial community trust and onboarding are in local apps. If I could go back, I’d involve institutional partners earlier in the design process.</p>
